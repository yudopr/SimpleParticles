# SimpleParticles
A simple GSAP particle engine without the need to use canvas. Only need single div for container and it will generate inline SVG along with the particles.


### TODO
1. Fix the blipped particles on loopOut cycle, not happening on loopOut pingpong
2. Add shape type to have rectangle, text or img
3. Fix smooth opacity per particle
4. Add interaction detection to reset idle timer
